# Scenario: Healthcare Data Analytics Platform

We’d like you to design a cloud infrastructure solution for a healthcare data analytics platform. This platform will need to ingest, store, and analyze large volumes of patient data from various source systems, such as electronic health records (EHRs). It’s important that the platform is compliant with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA) and offers robust security, scalability, and reliability.

Here are the core components your platform might include:

- **Data Ingestion**: Mechanisms to ingest data from multiple sources in real-time or batch.
- **Data Storage**: A scalable storage solution to store raw and processed data.
- **Data Processing**: Capabilities to process and transform data using ETL pipelines.
- **Analytics Engine**: Tools and services to analyze data, generate reports, and run machine learning models.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: To ensure the platform's health and performance can be tracked and issues can be diagnosed.
- **Compliance**: Implement measures to ensure data privacy and security compliance with regulations such as HIPAA.

## Instructions

### Diagram

- Use your favorite diagramming tool to create a detailed architecture diagram of your proposed solution.
- Clearly label each component and the interactions between them.
- Include all necessary cloud services (e.g., compute, storage, networking, security, monitoring).
- Show how the solution ensures security, scalability, reliability, and compliance.

### Explanation

- Provide a brief explanation of your design choices.
- Justify the use of each service and component.
- Explain how your solution meets the requirements of security, scalability, reliability, and compliance.

## Submission

- Submit the architecture diagram in PDF format.
- Include the written explanation in the same document or as a separate PDF.
